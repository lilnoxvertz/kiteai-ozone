## ATTENTION
-  MAKE SURE ALL OF THE ADDRESS THAT YOU WILL USE ON THE BOT, HAS ALREADY BEEN REGISTERED MANUALLY FROM THE WEBSITE, OR ELSE THE BOT WON'T WORK
-  AFTER DOING THE DAILY QUIZ BY USING THE BOT, YOU DONT NEED TO DO ANOTHER QUIZ IF YOU WERE CHECKING IT ON THE WEB. I KNOW THE QUIZ FROM THE WEB STILL CAN BE SUBMITTED, BUT IT WONT ADD ANY POINT SINCE YOU'VE DONE IT FROM THE BOT FIRST.
